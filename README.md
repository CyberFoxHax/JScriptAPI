# JScriptAPI
Attemp at learning JScript and documenting their api properly.

API is decsribed in pseudo C# btw
----

Why?
Miscrosoft has made efforts to make Windows a scripting environment. But quite frankly, they all turned out to be crap.


Batch language (.bat) - doing a for loop: "for /l %x in (1, 1, 100) do echo %x". It's ugliest fucking unicorn i have ever seen.

Visual Basic Script (.vbs) - packed with useful stuff, but sadly it's... Visual Basic.

Power Shell (.ps1) - framework is functional and clean. The language is OK. Basic execution is drowned in permissions clusterfuck.

JScript (.js) - 
now this is interesting. JScript compiles standard ECMAScript 5 and uses the same framework as VBS. Sadly it's very poorly documented. But i will master this, and create a complete api for their framework.
